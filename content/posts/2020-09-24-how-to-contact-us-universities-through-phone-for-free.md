## Introduction

While applying to US universities, you will have a lot of questions that need to be answered quickly. We all know calling a phone number is always faster than sending an email. In this blog, I will provide tools through which you can make a free phone call to any US phone number using the internet or mobile application. 

During my own application process, I have had one situation when I had submitted my documents through email and didn’t receive a reply whether they received it or not. Then, I had to make a paid phone call to make sure they have received it. I hope you don't have to face this situation, however, if you do and have to make a phone call to US university/college, you can use these methods:

## CitrusTel

[CitrusTel](https://www.citrustel.com/) is a VOIP phone that needs the internet to connect phone calls from a web browser to any mobile or landline phone number in the USA. You just have to enter the phone number on the dial pad and click on “Call”.

## Globfone

[Globfone](https://globfone.com/call-phone) is another innovative VOIP call service to make internet calls to the USA for free. You do not have to create an account to place free calls to both landlines and mobile phones in the USA. You have to select the country, enter the phone number and check on an “I’m not a robot” reCAPTCHA to make a free call.
